-- MySQL is case insensitive

-- the following line of code uses the select function to show "population" from  the "country" table from the "world" database. Select and from are the MySQL keywords.
SELECT Population FROM world.country;

-- this next line of code uses the select function to show both "name" and "population" of countries silmutaneously from data taken from the "country" table from the "world" database
-- MySQLWorkbench just shows all keywords in blue, hence 'Name' shown as blue in MySQL. But 'Name' is clearly allowed as a column name since we were able to use it. 
-- Some keywords like "SELECT" or "DELETE" are not allowed to be used as column names just as is - if you wanted to use them you would have to put quotes around them, I believe.
SELECT Name, Population FROM world.country;

-- the following line of code will show all of the data in the "country" table from "world" database
-- this is considered bad practise unless you really need all the data. Better to select data.
SELECT * from world.country;
